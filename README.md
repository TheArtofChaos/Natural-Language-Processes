# Load the dataset (SMSSpamCollection) into a Pandas DataFrame.
Preprocess the text data using techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization. You can use libraries such as NLTK or spaCy for this.
Extract features from the preprocessed text data using the Bag-of-Words method. You can use scikit-learn's CountVectorizer for this.
Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Train and evaluate classification models using different classifiers.
Evaluate the performance of the classifiers.
Experiment with different hyperparameters of the classifiers to see how they affect the performance of the models.
Visualize the performance of the classifiers using techniques such as confusion matrix or ROC curve.
