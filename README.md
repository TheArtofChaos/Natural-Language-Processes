#Natural Language Processes 

The following tasks were performed:

1. The dataset (SMSSpamCollection) was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. The text data was preprocessed using techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization. NLTK or spaCy libraries were utilized for this purpose.
3. Features were extracted from the preprocessed text data using the Bag-of-Words method. The CountVectorizer from scikit-learn was employed for this step.
4. The dataset was split into training and test sets.
5. Classification models were trained and evaluated using various classifiers.
6. The performance of the classifiers was assessed.
7. Different hyperparameters of the classifiers were experimented with to observe their impact on the model's performance.
8. The performance of the classifiers was visualized using techniques such as confusion matrix or ROC curve.
